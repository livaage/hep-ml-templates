# Dataset Info
dataset_info:
  name: "Medical Diagnosis Dataset"
  description: "Binary classification for medical diagnosis"
  domain: "Healthcare/Medical"
  
# Just change these basic settings!
file_path: "data/medical_diagnosis.csv"
target_column: "diagnosis"  # Different target name

# Structure
has_header: true
separator: ","
encoding: "utf-8"

# Target Configuration - Different task
target_type: "binary"  # Medical diagnosis: positive/negative

# Feature Configuration (if needed)
# column_names: ["age", "gender", "symptom1", "symptom2", "diagnosis"]

# Quality Control
validation: true
verbose: true

# Medical-specific missing value handling
missing_values: 
  - ""
  - "NA" 
  - "NaN"
  - "unknown"
  - "not_available"
  - "N/A"
  - "missing"
  - "?"
  - "-"
  - "null"

drop_missing_threshold: 0.85  # Slightly lower for medical data

# Advanced Settings (optional)
# preprocessing_options:
#   handle_categorical: true
#   scale_features: false  # Medical data might need different scaling

# The power of true modularity:
# ✅ Same loader works for HEP physics data
# ✅ Same loader works for medical data  
# ✅ Same loader works for any CSV dataset
# ✅ Zero code changes needed - just config!
