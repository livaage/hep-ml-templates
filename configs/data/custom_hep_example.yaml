# Custom HEP Dataset Configuration Example
# ========================================
# Example configuration for a custom High Energy Physics dataset
# This shows how easy it is to adapt to any new HEP dataset!

block: ingest.csv

# === REQUIRED SETTINGS ===
file_path: "data/my_hep_experiment.csv" # Your dataset file
target_column: "signal_type" # Target column name

# === DATASET STRUCTURE ===
has_header: true # CSV has column headers
separator: "," # Standard CSV format
encoding: "utf-8" # UTF-8 encoding

# If you need to rename columns or your CSV has no header:
# column_names:
#   - "event_id"
#   - "track_pt"
#   - "track_eta"
#   - "track_phi"
#   - "cluster_energy"
#   - "cluster_eta"
#   - "cluster_phi"
#   - "missing_et"
#   - "jet_count"
#   - "signal_type"

# === DATA SAMPLING ===
# For development/testing with large HEP datasets
nrows: 50000 # Use first 50k events for quick testing
# sample_fraction: 0.05                 # Alternative: 5% random sample

# === TARGET PROCESSING ===
target_type: "multiclass" # Classification task
# positive_class_labels: ["signal", "S", 1]  # For binary classification

# === HEP-SPECIFIC PREPROCESSING ===
missing_values: ["", "NA", "NaN", "null", "NULL", "-999", "-99", "inf"] # Common HEP missing values
drop_missing_threshold: 0.9 # Keep columns with <90% missing (HEP data can be sparse)

# === QUALITY CONTROL ===
validation: true # Perform data validation
verbose: true # Show loading details

# === TIPS FOR HEP RESEARCHERS ===
#
# 1. Common HEP target types:
#    - "binary": signal vs background
#    - "multiclass": particle type classification
#    - "regression": energy/momentum prediction
#
# 2. Typical HEP missing value indicators:
#    -999, -99, inf, nan, empty strings
#
# 3. For large datasets (millions of events):
#    - Start with nrows: 10000 for testing
#    - Use sample_fraction for random sampling
#    - Set verbose: false for production runs
#
# 4. Column naming conventions:
#    - pt, eta, phi for kinematic variables
#    - E, energy for energy measurements
#    - m, mass for invariant masses
#    - missing_et, met for missing energy
