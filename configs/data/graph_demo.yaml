# Graph Dataset Configuration for GNN
# ===================================
# This configuration creates a graph from CSV data suitable for GNN training

block: ingest.graph_csv

# === REQUIRED SETTINGS ===
file_path: "data/graph_nodes_demo.csv" # Node features and labels
target_column: "label" # Target column for node classification

# === DATASET STRUCTURE ===
has_header: true # CSV has column headers
separator: "," # Standard CSV format
encoding: "utf-8" # UTF-8 encoding

# === GRAPH STRUCTURE ===
# For GNN, we create edges based on node feature similarity
edge_threshold: 0.3 # Cosine similarity threshold for edges (0-1)
max_edges_per_node: 8 # Maximum edges per node
